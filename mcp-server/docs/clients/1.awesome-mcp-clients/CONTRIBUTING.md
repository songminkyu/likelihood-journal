# Contributing to Awesome MCP Servers

Contributions are welcome and encouraged! Whether you're fixing a typo, adding a new client, or suggesting improvements, your help is appreciated.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository:** Click the "Fork" button in the top right corner of the GitHub page.

2. **Create a new branch:**  Create a new branch for your changes.  This keeps your changes separate from the main project until they're ready to be merged. A good branch name describes the changes you're making, e.g., `add-new-client` or `fix-typo`.

   ```bash
   git checkout -b add-new-client
   ```

3. **Make your changes:** Edit the `README.md` file with your additions or corrections. Please follow the existing format and style. When adding a new client, make sure to include:

    * The client name, linked to its repository/website.
    * A brief description of the client's functionality.

4. **Commit your changes:** Commit your changes with a clear and concise message explaining what you've done.

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add new XYZ client"
   ```

5. **Push your branch:** Push your branch to your forked repository.

   ```bash
   git push origin add-new-client
   ```

6. **Create a pull request:** Go to the original repository and click the "New pull request" button. Select your forked repository and branch. Provide a clear title and description of your changes in the pull request.

7. **Review and merge:** Your pull request will be reviewed by the maintainers. They may suggest changes or ask for clarification. Once the review is complete, your changes will be merged into the main project.


## Guidelines

* **Keep it consistent:** Follow the existing format and style of the `README.md` file. This includes formatting, capitalization, and punctuation.
* **Alphabetical order:** Maintain alphabetical order within each category of clients. This makes it easier to find specific clients.
* **Accurate information:** Ensure that all information is accurate and up-to-date. Double-check links and descriptions before submitting your changes.
* **One client per line:** List each client on a separate line for better readability.
* **Clear descriptions:** Write concise and informative descriptions for each client. Explain what the client does and what its key features are.
